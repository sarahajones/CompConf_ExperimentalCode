# CompConf_ExperimentalCode
Experimental Code used in the Computing Confidence project. 

This repository is used to store the experimental code created and used for the purpose of completing an MSC in Experimental Psychology. 
The code runs using MATLABS PsychToolbox and allows a tightly controlled psyhcophysical experiment to run on screen. 
The experimenter must be on hand to launch the code with the correct participant and session number. 

The code saves the data locally for further analysis.
